In around 1980s Unites States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency began the Distributed Sensor Network program which was aimed at developing distributed surveillance and tracking methods. The system consisted of six distributed sensor nodes, four acoustic nodes and two TV nodes and a test bed for tracking UH-I helicopters was created. Helicopters were detected by the acoustic nodes operating in surveillance mode. TV subsystem were then alerted and provided the tracker with additional measurements. A distributed algorithm was developed that incorporated the acoustic and TV measurements to obtain a overall track of the aircraft
