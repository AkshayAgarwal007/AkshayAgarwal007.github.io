In this article I'll introduce you to the field of Natural Langugae Processing. We'll have a look at why **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) is important and briefly discuss the various stages in processing of natural language. We'll also have a look at the state of the art of NLP.  

###What is Natural Language Processing?

It's the ability of systems to process natural language such as English rather than a language that has been designed specifically for computers like C. The system should take in the human speech, process it and derive some meaning out of it. But it's not that easy as it may seem. 

Why is this diffilcut for Computers?

We hardly face any difficulties in understanding a sentence in a language that we know and that's because we have a large knowledge base, mapping of words or sentences with our common sense knowledge of the world take place instantly inside our brain. We are easily able to derive meaning out of sentences by applying in our common sense knowledge alongwith our experience of similar situations even if there were a lot of ambiguties in the speech that we are hearing or the text that we are reading. This might sound funny in the beginning because this is very apparent to us and we take the processing of natural language inside our brain for granted but these our complex processes that scientists even intnsive research in this field have failed to understand in a way they would have loved to. And it is intresting to know that some of the difficulties that are there are because the natural language content contains a lot of ambiguities and that's because we omit a lot of common sense knowledge and keep a lot of ambiguities while we speak and that's because we assume that the reciever would be able to decipher it with his common sense knoledge and understanding of the context.

Let's take a conversation for example. (I have created this myself based on several examples that I remembered while writing this piece of text, It would be nice to get some feedback if anyone finds something wrong in this example)

Mom: It's raining today but the school is open.
Son: But I'm not feeling like going to school today.
Mom: Father will be angry if he comes to know about this.
Son: Ok I'm going to dress up.

For us this converastion might be easy to understand but for computers this can be difficult. Let's analyse this.

The first line might appear crystal clear to us because of our common sense knowledge of the world and experience of similar situations but this is not the case for computers. It's raining today. Okay. By this line we woulld instantly infer that it's raning outside the speaker's house and also in the area the son's school is located and though it's raining the school is open. But how does a computer understand this? How does it know where is it raining? What should it infer by raning 'today'? What relationship does raining have with the school being open and why the people concerned are dicussing the same? What does the word 'open' mean here? We know that it means the school is working but how should the computer infer that? 

In the third line what does the word 'Father' means? Does it mean the kid's father or father of the school. Why will the father be angry and at whom will he be angry? Also to infer about why the father would be angry we need to go one or two sentences back. 

"Ok I'm going to dress up." What does the kid intended to say here? We understand that he means he is getting ready for going to school but how does a computer understand that? Also we can have multiple interpretations in our mind at the same time for this sentence and can modify our thoughts or understanding and easily deal with the situation when one of our interprtations go wrong using some sort of feedback mechanism. How does the computer deal with such sort of ambiguous situation. Now you have clearly understood how diffilcult this can be but let's also see how this has been made easy by scientists doing immsense research in the field of Computer Linguistics, NLP and MAchine Learning and other related fields. I used the term 'easy' to symobolise the immense contribution of scientists, engineers and programmers in this field and there is a lot we have achieved but the state of art of NLP is a far from where we can feel satisfied and there is still a long way to go and this makes research in this field even more intresting.
